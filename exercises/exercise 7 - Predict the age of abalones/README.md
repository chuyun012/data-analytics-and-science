# Problem
The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.

Predict the age of abalone from physical measurements.

# Data

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Sex      | The gender of the abalone M, F, and I (infant) |
| Length   | Longest shell measurement |
| Diameter | perpendicular to length |
| Height   | with meat in shell |
| Whole weight | whole abalone |
| Shucked weight | weight of meat |
| Viscera weight | gut weight (after bleeding) |
| Shell weight | after being dried |
| Rings | Number of rings. Number of rings + 1.5 gives the age in years |
